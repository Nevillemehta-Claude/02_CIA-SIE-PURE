# PREAMBLE: THE COVENANT OF ORGANIZATION

This document establishes the **SUPREME AND IMMUTABLE PROTOCOL** for the systematic reorganization, classification, indexing, and governance of all files within the Downloads directory and its subdirectories.

## The Foundational Creed

> **"PATIENCE OVER SPEED. PRECISION OVER HASTE. DELIBERATION OVER AUTOMATION. VERIFICATION OVER ASSUMPTION. EXCELLENCE OVER EXPEDIENCY."**

Every action shall be executed with the care of an archivist handling rare manuscripts. No file shall be moved without verification. No folder shall be created without purpose. No index shall be finalized without triple-checking. No decision shall be made in haste.

## The Cardinal Truth

This exercise exists because over time, many governing principals, directives, protocols, and operational documents accumulate across various locations. These application-agnostic directives - whether HTML, DOCX, MD, PDF, or other formats - must be identified, classified, consolidated, and indexed into a centralized GOVERNANCE structure. All other files shall receive equal attention and organizational excellence.

---

# PART I: THE SACRED RULES OF EXECUTION (IMMUTABLE)

These rules are **INVIOLABLE**. No circumstance, no time pressure, no convenience shall override them.

## 1.1 The Eight Commandments

| Commandment | Description | Violation Response |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **I** | NEVER delete ANY file without explicit, confirmed user authorization | HALT all operations immediately |
| **II** | NEVER move more than ONE folder's contents at a time without verification | Pause and verify before proceeding |
| **III** | ALWAYS create the complete target structure BEFORE moving any files | Rebuild structure from scratch if violated |
| **IV** | ALWAYS preserve original file timestamps, metadata, and permissions | Restore if lost; report if impossible |
| **V** | ALWAYS maintain a complete reversibility log of every operation | Operations are VOID without logged evidence |
| **VI** | PAUSE after each folder/phase completion for mandatory verification | Cannot proceed without checkpoint clearance |
| **VII** | VERIFY every single file move individually - no batch assumptions | Re-verify entire batch if skipped |
| **VIII** | ASK user if classification is uncertain - NEVER guess or assume | Wait indefinitely for guidance |

## 1.2 The Three Pillars of Execution

| Pillar | Mandate | Implementation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **PATIENCE** | No folder shall be modified until its entire contents are understood | Read, analyze, comprehend before any action |
| **DELIBERATION** | Every move shall be intentional, purposeful, and documented | No action without recorded rationale |
| **VERIFICATION** | Each action shall be verified before, during, and after execution | Triple-check methodology required |

## 1.3 Prohibited Behaviors (ABSOLUTE)

The executing AI **SHALL NEVER**:

1. **Bulk move** files without individual review and verification
2. **Delete** any file without explicit user confirmation (even obvious duplicates)
3. **Rush** any operation - time pressure is NEVER a valid excuse
4. **Assume** file purpose - investigate or ask
5. **Proceed silently** on failures - all errors must be reported immediately
6. **Skip checkpoints** - each phase requires explicit user approval
7. **Guess classifications** - uncertainty demands user consultation
8. **Modify file contents** - this is an organizational exercise only
9. **Rename files** without explicit user instruction
10. **Override timestamps** - preservation is mandatory

## 1.4 Mandatory Behaviors (ABSOLUTE)

The executing AI **SHALL ALWAYS**:

1. **Process one file at a time** when moving files
2. **Verify source gone and destination present** after every move
3. **Document every action** in the running log
4. **Pause at all checkpoints** and await explicit user approval
5. **Preserve originals** - if unsure, copy first, then delete original only after verification
6. **Flag uncertainties** - place ambiguous items in TRIAGE and report
7. **Report progress** at regular intervals
8. **Maintain complete reversibility** at all times
9. **Generate comprehensive indices** upon completion
10. **Treat governance documents as highest priority**

# PART II: THE PHILOSOPHY OF ORGANIZATION

## 2.1 Guiding Principles

### Principle 1: Contextual Coherence
Files belong together based on their **PURPOSE** and **TOPIC**, not their file type, creation date, or arbitrary naming. A governance document is a governance document regardless of whether it is `.md`, `.docx`, `.html`, or `.pdf`.

### Principle 2: Hierarchical Clarity
The folder structure shall be **self-documenting**. Any observer should understand the contents from the folder name alone, without needing to open files or read descriptions.

### Principle 3: Temporal Resilience
The structure must **accommodate future additions** without requiring restructuring. New files should have an obvious home.

### Principle 4: Discovery Optimization
Any file should be **locatable within 3 levels** of navigation maximum from the root organizational folder.

### Principle 5: Governance Centralization
All directives, principles, protocols, standards, and governance documents shall be **consolidated into a single authoritative location** with comprehensive indexing.

### Principle 6: Complete Accountability
Every file must be **accounted for** at all times. The total count before reorganization MUST equal the total count after reorganization.

### Principle 7: Reversibility Guarantee
Every operation must be **reversible**. Complete logging ensures any action can be undone.

---

# PART III: CLASSIFICATION TAXONOMY

## 3.1 Primary Classification Categories

All files shall be classified into one of the following PRIMARY categories:

---

### CATEGORY A: GOVERNANCE & PRINCIPALS (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Definition**: Documents that establish rules, guidelines, directives, protocols, standards, behavioral instructions, or operational principles that govern AI systems, processes, workflows, or human-machine interactions.

#### What Constitutes a GOVERNANCE Document?

A **Governance Document** is ANY file that contains:

- Operating principles for AI systems (Claude, GPT, Copilot, etc.)
- System prompts or instruction sets
- Behavioral directives or constraints
- Workflow definitions or protocols
- Standards, guidelines, or best practices
- Meta-instructions (instructions about instructions)
- Configuration philosophies
- Decision frameworks
- Quality assurance rules
- Security policies
- Documentation standards
- Methodological frameworks

#### File Types to Scan for Governance Content

```
PRIMARY GOVERNANCE EXTENSIONS (Must scan every file):
├── .md (Markdown)
├── .txt (Plain text)
├── .html (Web exports, saved pages)
├── .docx (Word documents)
├── .doc (Legacy Word)
├── .pdf (PDF documents)
├── .json (Configuration files with instructional content)
├── .yaml/.yml (Configuration with directives)
├── .rtf (Rich text format)
└── .pages (Apple Pages - if exportable)

SECONDARY (Inspect if filename suggests governance):
├── .xml (Configuration files)
├── .toml (Configuration files)
└── .ini (Configuration files)
```

#### Governance Detection Heuristics

**STRONG INDICATORS (Automatic Classification as GOVERNANCE)**:
- Contains "You are..." or "Claude is..." or "The AI shall..."
- Contains "NEVER" or "ALWAYS" in instructional context
- Contains "RULE:" or "PRINCIPLE:" or "DIRECTIVE:" or "PROTOCOL:"
- Contains "IRONCLAD" or "STANDARD" or "GUIDELINE" or "FRAMEWORK"
- Contains "System Prompt" or "Operating Instructions"
- Contains "Behavioral" or "Constraint" or "Mandatory"
- Contains "must always" or "must never" or "shall not" or "is prohibited"
- Contains numbered lists of behavioral instructions
- Contains role definitions for AI systems
- Opens with declarative statements about how things SHALL/MUST/SHOULD be done
- Establishes rules that other documents or processes reference
- Defines standards of quality, behavior, or process
- Contains approval or authorization sections
- Contains version numbers with effective dates
- Contains compliance or adherence language

**MEDIUM INDICATORS (Review Required)**:
- Numbered lists of instructions
- Conditional logic (IF/THEN statements)
- Role definitions
- Capability boundaries
- "Do not" or "Always ensure" phrases
- Step-by-step procedural content
- References to other authoritative documents
- Uses imperative language extensively
- Defines roles and responsibilities

**WEAK INDICATORS (Manual User Review)**:
- Technical documentation with embedded instructions
- README files with operational guidance
- Configuration files with comments
- Tutorial content that includes best practices

# PART IV: EXECUTION PROTOCOL

## The Twelve Phases of Reorganization

Each phase is **MANDATORY** and **SEQUENTIAL**. No phase may be skipped. Each phase ends with a **MANDATORY CHECKPOINT** requiring explicit user approval.

---

## PHASE 0: PREPARATION (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)

### Step 0.1: Request and Confirm Access

```
Use: mcp__cowork__request_cowork_directory
Target: ~/Downloads (MacBook Downloads folder)
```

**OR** if using Claude Code directly:
- Confirm working directory access
- Verify ability to read and write to ~/Downloads

**WAIT** for explicit confirmation before proceeding.

### Step 0.2: Complete Inventory Scan

Execute comprehensive analysis:

```bash
# Total file count
find ~/Downloads -type f | wc -l

# Total folder count
find ~/Downloads -type d | wc -l

# Total size
du -sh ~/Downloads

# File type census (count by extension - top 30)
find ~/Downloads -type f -name "*.*" | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -30

# Date range analysis (macOS)
echo "Oldest file:"
find ~/Downloads -type f -exec stat -f "%m %N" {} \; 2>/dev/null | sort -n | head -1
echo "Newest file:"
find ~/Downloads -type f -exec stat -f "%m %N" {} \; 2>/dev/null | sort -n | tail -1

# Identify potential governance documents
echo "Potential governance documents:"
find ~/Downloads -type f \( -name "*.md" -o -name "*.txt" -o -name "*.docx" -o -name "*.pdf" -o -name "*.html" \) | wc -l
```

### Step 0.3: Generate Pre-Execution Report

**REPORT TO USER:**

**⏸️ MANDATORY PAUSE: WAIT for explicit user approval before proceeding.**

---

## PHASE 1: STRUCTURE CREATION

### Step 1.1: Create Master Folder Structure

Create the REORGANIZED folder inside ~/Downloads. Create folders **ONE AT A TIME** and **VERIFY each exists** before creating the next.

```
~/Downloads/REORGANIZED/

│
├── MASTER_INDEX.md
├── GOVERNANCE_INDEX.md
├── PROJECT_REGISTRY.md
├── REORGANIZATION_LOG.md
└── FILE_MANIFEST.csv
```

### Step 1.2: Create README Files

Place a README.md in EACH folder explaining its purpose. Example:

```markdown
# [FOLDER_NAME]

**Purpose**: [Brief description of what belongs in this folder]

**File Types**: [Expected extensions]

**Classification Criteria**: [How files are determined to belong here]

---
*Part of the IRONCLAD+ ULTIMATE organizational structure*
```

### Step 1.3: Structure Verification

After creating ALL folders:

```bash
# Verify structure exists
find ~/Downloads/REORGANIZED -type d | sort

# Count folders created
find ~/Downloads/REORGANIZED -type d | wc -l
```

**⏸️ CHECKPOINT: Report structure to user. Wait for approval before proceeding.**

---

## PHASE 2: GOVERNANCE DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

This is the **HIGHEST PRIORITY** phase. Every potential governance document must be identified and classified.

### Step 2.1: Scan for Governance Candidates

```bash
# Find all potential governance documents
find ~/Downloads -type f \( \
  -name "*.md" -o \
  -name "*.txt" -o \
  -name "*.html" -o \
  -name "*.docx" -o \
  -name "*.doc" -o \
  -name "*.pdf" -o \
  -name "*.rtf" -o \
  -name "*.json" -o \
  -name "*.yaml" -o \
  -name "*.yml" \
\) -not -path "*/REORGANIZED/*" > /tmp/governance_candidates.txt
```

### Step 2.2: Analyze Each Candidate

For EACH potential governance document:

```
1. READ the file content completely (first 200 lines minimum)
2. ANALYZE against governance indicators (see Part III)
3. DETERMINE if it IS a governance document:

   IF STRONG INDICATORS FOUND:
   → Classify as GOVERNANCE
   → Determine specific subfolder

   IF MEDIUM INDICATORS FOUND:
   → Review content more carefully
   → Make classification decision OR ask user

   IF WEAK INDICATORS ONLY:
   → Flag for manual user review
   → Place in _TRIAGE/_PENDING_REVIEW

4. IF GOVERNANCE:
   a. CLASSIFY into specific subfolder (01-10)
   b. LOG planned move in GOVERNANCE_MANIFEST.md
   c. Record: source path, destination, rationale, confidence level

5. IF UNCERTAIN:
   a. ASK user for classification guidance
   b. WAIT indefinitely for response
   c. DO NOT GUESS
```

### Step 2.3: Create Governance Manifest

Before moving any files, create `GOVERNANCE_MANIFEST.md`:

```markdown
# GOVERNANCE DOCUMENT MANIFEST

**Scan Date**: [DATE TIME]
**Total Candidates Scanned**: [X]
**Confirmed Governance Documents**: [Y]
**Pending User Review**: [Z]

---

## CONFIRMED GOVERNANCE DOCUMENTS

| # | Current Path | Destination | Confidence | Rationale |
|---|--------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | /path/to/file1.md | 01_AI_SYSTEM_PROMPTS | HIGH | Contains Claude system prompt |
| 2 | /path/to/file2.md | 02_OPERATING_PRINCIPLES | HIGH | IRONCLAD behavioral rules |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

---

## PENDING USER REVIEW

| # | Current Path | Possible Destination | Notes |
|---|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| 1 | /path/to/ambiguous.md | 03 or 04 | Contains both workflow and standard elements |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

---

**Awaiting user approval to proceed with moves**
```

**⏸️ CHECKPOINT: Present manifest to user. Wait for approval of ALL classifications before moving ANY files.**

### Step 2.4: Execute Governance Migration

Only after user approval of the manifest:

```
For EACH confirmed governance document (ONE AT A TIME):

1. VERIFY file still exists at source path
2. VERIFY destination folder exists
3. LOG the planned move with timestamp
4. EXECUTE: mv "[source]" "[destination]"
5. VERIFY file EXISTS at destination
6. VERIFY file is READABLE at destination
7. VERIFY file is NOT at source (move complete)
8. UPDATE FILE_MANIFEST.csv
9. UPDATE REORGANIZATION_LOG.md
10. REPORT: "✓ [filename] → GOVERNANCE/[subfolder]"

IF ANY STEP FAILS:
→ STOP immediately
→ Report error
→ Wait for user guidance
```

### Step 2.5: Report Governance Completion

- **COMPLETED**: Finished, delivered
- **ON_HOLD**: Paused, may resume
- **ARCHIVED**: Historical, unlikely to resume

### Step 3.3: Execute Project Migration

```
For EACH project:

1. CREATE project subfolder: PROJECTS/[STATUS]/[PROJECT_NAME]/
2. CREATE internal structure if needed (Requirements, Design, etc.)
3. FOR EACH file belonging to project:
   a. LOG planned move
   b. EXECUTE move
   c. VERIFY move succeeded
   d. UPDATE manifest
4. CHECKPOINT after each project complete
```

# Compare to original count from Phase 0
# MUST MATCH
```

### Step 11.2: Structural Verification

```bash
# Verify no files remain in original locations (except REORGANIZED folder)
find ~/Downloads -type f -not -path "*/REORGANIZED/*" | wc -l
# Should be 0 (or only the original directive file)

# PART V: OPERATIONAL SAFEGUARDS

## 5.1 Mandatory Pause Points

The executing AI **SHALL** pause and await explicit user input at:

| # | After Phase | Pause Reason |
|---|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Phase 0 | Inventory complete - confirm scope |
| 2 | Phase 1 | Structure created - confirm layout |
| 3 | Phase 2 | Governance manifest created - approve classifications |
| 4 | Phase 2 | Governance docs moved - verify critical documents |
| 5 | Phase 3 | Projects organized - verify project groupings |
| 6 | Phase 4 | Assets organized - verify media files |
| 7 | Phase 5 | Data files organized - verify data integrity |
| 8 | Phase 6 | Archives/installers done - verify nothing lost |
| 9 | Phase 7 | Docs/research done - verify categorization |
| 10 | Phase 8 | Comms/templates done - verify placement |
| 11 | Phase 9 | Unclassified review - user must classify |
| 12 | Phase 10 | Indices generated - verify accuracy |
| 13 | Phase 11 | Final verification - confirm completion |

## 5.2 Error Handling Protocol

If ANY error occurs:

1. **STOP** immediately - do not continue
2. **LOG** the error with full details (timestamp, operation, error message)
3. **PRESERVE** the current state - do not attempt cleanup
4. **REPORT** to user with exact error message and context
5. **WAIT** for user guidance - indefinitely if necessary
6. **DO NOT** attempt automatic recovery or workarounds

## 5.3 Batch Processing Protection

If more than **50 files** need processing in one category:

1. Process in batches of **25 files**
2. **CHECKPOINT** after each batch
3. Report progress: "Batch X/Y complete (Z files processed)"
4. Allow user to pause/continue between batches
5. Log each batch separately

## 5.4 Timeout Protection

If any single operation takes more than **60 seconds**:

1. Report the delay to user immediately
2. Describe what operation is taking long
3. Ask if should continue or abort
4. Wait for user response
5. Do not timeout silently

## 5.5 Duplicate Handling Protocol

If duplicate files are detected:

1. Identify all duplicates (by content hash or exact name+size)
2. Move ALL copies to `_TRIAGE/_DUPLICATES/`
3. Report list to user with recommendations
4. **NEVER** delete any duplicate without explicit user instruction
5. Wait for user to decide which to keep

## 5.6 Conflict Resolution

If two files have the same name in the destination:

1. DO NOT overwrite
2. Report the conflict to user
3. Options:
   - Append version indicator: `-v1`, `-v2`
   - Append date: `-2026-01-18`
   - Move to `_TRIAGE` for user decision
4. Wait for user instruction
5. Document the decision in the log

---

# PART VI: REVERSIBILITY GUARANTEE

## 6.1 The Reversibility Covenant

Every operation performed under this directive is **FULLY REVERSIBLE** because:

1. **Complete logging** of all move operations with timestamps
2. **Original paths preserved** in FILE_MANIFEST.csv
3. **No deletions** ever performed without explicit user confirmation
4. **Timestamps preserved** on all files
5. **Manifest is authoritative** - can reconstruct original state

## 6.2 Reversal Procedure

To reverse any single move:

```bash
# Read original path from FILE_MANIFEST.csv
# Move file back to original location
mv "[new_path]" "[original_path]"
```

To reverse ALL moves (full rollback):

```bash
# Script to be generated from FILE_MANIFEST.csv
# Each line: mv "[new_path]" "[original_path]"
```

## 6.3 Reversal Safeguards

Before ANY reversal:

1. Verify the manifest file exists and is intact
2. Verify the destination (original) paths are accessible
3. Create a reversal log
4. Process ONE FILE AT A TIME
5. Verify each reversal before proceeding

---

# PART VII: QUALITY GATES

## 7.1 Phase Quality Gates

Before declaring ANY phase complete, verify:

| Gate | Requirement | Verification Method |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| Completeness | All items in scope have been processed | Count comparison |
| Accuracy | Spot-check 10% of items for correct placement | Manual review |
| Documentation | All actions are logged in REORGANIZATION_LOG.md | Log review |
| Verification | Source gone, destination present for each move | File system check |
| Reversibility | FILE_MANIFEST.csv entry exists for each move | Manifest review |
| No Data Loss | File count before = file count after | Count comparison |

## 7.2 Final Quality Gate

Before final completion declaration:

- [ ] Original file count equals final file count
- [ ] No files were deleted
- [ ] All moves were verified individually
- [ ] All indices were generated
- [ ] All indices are accurate (spot-checked)
- [ ] FILE_MANIFEST.csv is complete
- [ ] REORGANIZATION_LOG.md is complete
- [ ] No errors occurred OR all errors were resolved
- [ ] User reviewed _TRIAGE folder
- [ ] User acknowledged completion
